This website is a personal project created as a voyeuristic commentary on heteronormativity. While most websites are welcoming and accommodating, visitors find themselves interrupting something on edwin.xxx — assaulted by the flashing text "LOOKING FOR THIS?" the user is led to click, naturally, and finds themselves cycling through equally aggressive flashing videos and close-ups, seemingly without pattern. The question is raised repeatedly: "LOOKING FOR THIS?"

The scene is bleak — a wilting plant, symmetrical windows with the blinds sealed, a gray shirt, and a brandless burger as a meal. The visitor sits across from a figure, staring. Is this normal? Is this something anyone wants? To sit down and share a meal is a classic aspect of the "normal" couple. In a generation with little religious attachment, young people find meaning and companionship in their significant others — one of the only rituals left is sharing a meal. Edwin.xxx distorts this tradition into something twisted and uncomfortable to encourage the user to question: "LOOKING FOR THIS?"
